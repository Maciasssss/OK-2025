Prime factors are the prime numbers that, when multiplied together, give a specific number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.
For example, let's break down the prime factorization of some numbers:

12:

12 = 2 × 2 × 3
Prime factors: 2 (appears twice) and 3
We write this as 2² × 3


30:

30 = 2 × 3 × 5
Prime factors: 2, 3, and 5


100:

100 = 2 × 2 × 5 × 5
Prime factors: 2 (twice) and 5 (twice)
We write this as 2² × 5²



In our subset product problem, we use prime factorization to convert a multiplication problem into an addition problem:

Instead of finding numbers whose product equals the target, we look for numbers whose combined prime factors match the target's prime factorization
For example, if our target has the prime factorization 2³ × 3² × 5, we need to select numbers whose prime factors, when combined, give exactly 3 factors of 2, 2 factors of 3, and 1 factor of 5

This approach works well with the Clingo solver because:

It avoids integer overflow with large numbers
It converts multiplication (finding products) into addition (counting factors)
It allows us to precisely model the constraints of the problem

The prime factorization is unique for every number, which is why this approach guarantees finding the correct subset whose product equals the target.
